# Entities and Bias in Broadcast Media: A Temporal and Contextual Analysis
This work conducts a broadcast analysis, which explores structures of the mention of entities on a system of television networks. Handling data on broadcast dates, stations and entities, we analyze when, how often and on what networks the entities appear in the media. This study standardizes and stretches out the column of entities; thus, it becomes possible to analyze the amount and importance of each entity in more detail. As a result, we identified the interesting entities and described their trends of mentioning. We also address differences across networks regarding mention of entities and the nature of entities present in the coverage. Other than content, thus, we seek other factors that determine media attention on subjects. Network a co-occurrence study points out, the degree to which the pairs of entities twinned on the broadcasts. These observations serve to clarify the image of the processes taking place in the media field, and will focus on the subsequent analysis of the media and its impact on public opinion.
